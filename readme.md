If I design a new digital currency on the Ethereum blockchain then this code acts as the blueprint for that currency. 
First, it establishes some ground rules: anyone can use the code freely, and it's written for a specific version of the
programming language Solidity. Then, it incorporates pre-built tools from OpenZeppelin to save time and ensure the currency 
functions correctly, similar to using a recipe instead of inventing every step of cooking.

The code defines a new type of digital asset called "SimpleToken" based on the ERC20 standard, which is a set of rules 
for how tokens work on Ethereum. It gives this digital currency a name ("ArtificialIntelligence") and a symbol ("AI") for easy 
identification during trading. Finally, the code mints 100 brand new "Metacrafter" tokens and assigns them to the person 
who deploys the contract, similar to how the first person using this code would receive the initial supply. In essence, 
this code creates a basic building block for a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.
